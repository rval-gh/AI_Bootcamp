# AI_Bootcamp

The FruitPunch AI Bootcamp that runs over 8 weeks concludes with a 2 week Capstone project.  Over that period, the Bootcamp presented an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  It also included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Engineering techniques such as merging, casting, imputing and encoding.  The more advanced topics covered AI bias, Automated ML and transfer learning.

The Google Colab notebook in this repository is my attempt at the Capstone project.
